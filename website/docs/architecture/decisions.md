# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

ADRs document significant architectural decisions for CAF: context, decision, and consequences.

## Index

| ADR | Title |
|-----|--------|
| [ADR-001](/docs/architecture/adr-001-folder-structure) | The `caf/` folder structure |
| [ADR-002](/docs/architecture/adr-002-pulse-vs-ploc) | Pulse vs Ploc: when to use each |
| [ADR-003](/docs/architecture/adr-003-routing) | Routing abstraction (RouteManager / RouteRepository) |
| [ADR-004](/docs/architecture/adr-004-packages) | Package separation (monorepo and scoped packages) |

## Format

Each ADR uses:

- **Title** — Short descriptive name
- **Status** — Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded
- **Context** — What is the issue?
- **Decision** — What did we decide?
- **Consequences** — Results (positive and negative)
